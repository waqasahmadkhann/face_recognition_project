# AI Security & Face Recognition System

This repository contains a high-performance surveillance solution that integrates real-time motion detection and deep-learning-based face recognition.

## Project Description
The system monitors a video feed (webcam or RTSP) and can identify individuals or raise alerts for unknown people.

Key components:
- Recognition Engine (`main.py`): Real-time monitoring and logging
- Enrollment Portal (`enrollment.py`): GUI for adding and managing users

## My Contribution
I studied, adapted, and worked on this project as part of my AI and computer vision learning.
I explored real-time face recognition, model evaluation, and system deployment techniques.

## Technologies
- Python
- OpenCV, dlib, face_recognition
- GUI programming
- Data Logging

## Note
This project is forked from George20021/face_recognition_project and used for educational purposes and portfolio development.
