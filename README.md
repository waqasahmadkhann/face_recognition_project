# AI Security & Face Recognition System

A high-performance surveillance solution that integrates **real-time motion detection**, **deep-learning-based face recognition**, and **automated security logging**. This system is designed to monitor a video feed (webcam or RTSP) and autonomously identify individuals or capture alerts for strangers.

## System Overview

The project consists of two core applications:
* **The Recognition Engine (`main.py`)**: A multi-threaded monitoring system that handles live analysis and data logging.
* **The Enrollment Portal (`enrollment.py`)**: A modern GUI for onboarding new users and managing biometric data.

## Architectural Decisions

### 1. Multi-Threaded Performance
To ensure the video feed remains smooth and lag-free, the system separates tasks into independent threads:
* **Frame Grabber Thread**: Continuously pulls new frames from the camera to prevent buffer lag.
* **Face Analyzer Thread**: Handles the heavy computation, including motion detection and AI recognition.
* **Database Writer Thread**: Uses a **Queue system** to handle SQL writes in the background so the AI logic is never interrupted by disk I/O.

### 2. Intelligent Motion Triggering
Unlike basic systems that run AI on every single frame, this system utilizes **Background Subtraction** to save resources:
* The system calculates the **"delta"** between the current frame and a weighted average of previous frames.
* **AI analysis only activates** when significant motion is detected, drastically reducing CPU/GPU overhead.

### 3. Deep Learning Recognition
* **Algorithm**: Utilizes the `face_recognition` library, which is built on dlib’s state-of-the-art **HOG (Histogram of Oriented Gradients)** model.
* **Optimization**: Frames are downscaled to **25% of their size** (0.25x) for the recognition pass, then scaled back up for display, maintaining real-time performance.

### 4. Professional Data Management
* **SQLite Logging**: Every detection is stored in a structured SQL database with a name, timestamp, and status.
* **Signature Caching**: Facial encodings are **"pickled"** into a cache file (`face_signatures.pkl`). This allows the system to load known faces instantly on startup without re-processing image files.
* **Stranger Alerts**: If an unknown face is detected, the system captures a high-resolution snapshot and logs a **"Security Alert"** to the database.

## Technical Stack

* **OpenCV**: Used for video stream manipulation and image processing.
* **Dlib / Face_Recognition**: Powers the facial feature extraction and distance matching.
* **CustomTkinter**: A modern wrapper for Tkinter used to build a dark-themed, professional enrollment interface.
* **SQLite3**: Provides a lightweight, reliable database for thread-safe security logs.
* **Python-Dotenv**: Manages sensitive configuration like RTSP URLs and directory paths.

## Setup and Usage

### Configuration
1.  Create a **.env** file in the root folder.
2.  Set **RTSP_URL=0** for a local webcam or enter your IP camera link.
3.  Define your **KNOWN_FACES_DIR** for storing enrollment photos.

### Enrollment
Run `enrollment.py` to add new authorized users:
* **Enter the user's name** in the input field.
* **Capture 5 distinct photos** using the **"Snap Photo"** button.
* The app automatically **clears the AI cache** (`face_signatures.pkl`) so the new user is recognized immediately upon the next system start.

### Recognition
Run `main.py` to start the security monitor:
* **Known users** will be outlined in **GREEN**.
* **Strangers** will be outlined in **RED**, and their photo will be saved to the `captured_strangers` folder.
* Logs can be reviewed in the **security_log.db** file.

* Any other file needed (database, logs.txt etc) will be made after the first run of the code
